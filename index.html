  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>AI Channel Copilot</strong></p>
  <p><small>Effective date: <strong>[YYYY-MM-DD]</strong></small></p>

  <div class="notice">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This template is for general information only and does not
    constitute legal advice. Privacy laws differ by country and by how you use data. You should
    review and adapt this policy with your own legal counsel before publishing it.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Who I am</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>AI Channel Copilot</strong> (the “App”) is operated by
    <strong>[Your Full Name]</strong>, an individual developer based in
    <strong>[Country/Region]</strong> (“I”, “me”, or “my”).
  </p>
  <p>
    The App provides analytics and attribution tools to merchants who run stores on Shopify
    (“merchants”, “you”). When a merchant installs the App, I access certain data from their
    Shopify store to provide the Service described in this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can contact me at:
  </p>
  <p>
    Email: <a href="mailto:[email protected]">[email protected]</a><br />
    Address: <strong>[Your mailing address or city, country]</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>2. Relationship with Shopify and merchants</h2>
  <p>
    I am a third-party app developer and not an employee or representative of Shopify.
    When you install the App, Shopify shares certain store data with me through the Shopify API
    according to the permissions that you approve. For most data about your customers, I act as a
    <em>service provider / data processor</em> on your behalf, and you remain responsible for
    complying with privacy laws that apply to your store.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information I collect</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Information about you and your store</h3>
  <p>
    When you install and use the App, I may collect and store:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Store information (for example: store name, myshopify domain, primary domain, currency, time zone).</li>
    <li>Contact details that Shopify provides (for example: account owner name and email address).</li>
    <li>Subscription data (for example: plan type, billing status) if I use Shopify Billing.</li>
    <li>Configuration data (for example: AI domain rules, UTM mappings, tagging and retention settings).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Information about orders and customers</h3>
  <p>
    To provide AI-channel analytics, I access order and customer information from your Shopify store,
    including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Order details: order ID, order date, currency, line items, quantities, prices, discounts, taxes, and refunds.</li>
    <li>Basic customer details: customer ID and contact fields that you authorize via Shopify
        (such as name, email, phone, billing and shipping country/region).</li>
    <li>Traffic attributes: referring site, landing page URL, UTM parameters, tags, and note attributes related to orders.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I use this data to identify orders that likely came from AI assistants (for example ChatGPT,
    Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot) and to calculate metrics such as GMV, order counts, and customer
    cohorts for your dashboards and exports.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Technical and usage data</h3>
  <p>
    When you access the App through the Shopify admin, my systems may automatically log:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address and approximate location.</li>
    <li>Browser type, operating system, and device information.</li>
    <li>Pages and features used in the App, timestamps, and error logs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I use this information to maintain security, improve performance, and understand how the App is used.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4 Support and communications</h3>
  <p>
    If you contact me for support, I will collect the information that you choose to provide,
    such as your name, email address, and the content of your message.
  </p>

  <h2>4. How I use the information</h2>
  <p>I use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the App and its analytics features.</li>
    <li>To attribute orders to AI channels and generate dashboards, reports, and CSV exports.</li>
    <li>To configure the App based on your settings and preferences.</li>
    <li>To provide technical support and respond to your questions or requests.</li>
    <li>To monitor performance, debug issues, and improve the App.</li>
    <li>To prevent abuse, fraud, and security incidents.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce my terms and policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal bases (for EEA/UK etc.)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or a similar jurisdiction
    that requires a legal basis for processing, I rely on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing necessary to provide the App to you as a merchant.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> Maintaining and improving the App, monitoring abuse,
        and supporting you, where these interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where I explicitly ask for your consent for certain processing
        (for example, optional communications). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. How I share information</h2>
  <p>
    I do <strong>not</strong> sell your or your customers’ personal information.
  </p>
  <p>I may share information in these limited situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Service providers:</strong> I use third-party providers (for example hosting,
      database, monitoring, and email services) that process data on my behalf under written agreements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Business or legal reasons:</strong> I may disclose information if required to do so by law,
      in response to valid legal requests, or to protect my rights, property, or safety.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    I keep personal data for as long as necessary to provide the App and to meet the purposes
    described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you uninstall the App, I generally delete or anonymize store-related personal data within
    <strong>[X months]</strong>, except where I need to keep some records longer (for example for
    accounting, tax, or fraud-prevention purposes). Aggregated or de-identified data that no longer
    identifies any individual may be kept for analytics and product improvement.
  </p>

  <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    I may store and process information on servers located in countries other than your own.
    These countries may have different data-protection laws. Where required, I will use appropriate
    safeguards to protect personal data transferred across borders.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Your rights and choices</h2>

  <h3>9.1 Merchant rights</h3>
  <p>
    As a merchant, you can access and update certain store and configuration information through the Shopify admin
    and the App’s settings. You can uninstall the App at any time from your Shopify admin, which stops future data
    access from your store.
  </p>

  <h3>9.2 End-customer rights</h3>
  <p>
    If you are a customer of a merchant using the App and want to exercise rights over your personal data
    (such as access, correction, or deletion), please contact the store directly. I will assist the merchant
    in responding to such requests, in line with Shopify’s requirements and applicable law.
  </p>

  <h3>9.3 Additional privacy rights</h3>
  <p>
    Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights, such as the right to object to certain
    processing, to request restriction of processing, or to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.
    To exercise these rights in relation to the App, please contact me using the details above.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>
    I use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal information from accidental
    or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized access. However, no online service can
    guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for use by merchants and business users only. It is not directed to children,
    and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or a higher age where
    required by local law).
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If I make material changes, I will notify merchants
    by email or through the App and update the “Effective date” at the top of this page.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Contact</h2>
