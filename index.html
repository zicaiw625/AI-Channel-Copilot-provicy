  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>AI Channel Copilot</strong></p>
  <p><small>Effective date: <strong>[YYYY-MM-DD]</strong></small></p>

  <div class="notice">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This template is provided for information only and does not constitute legal advice.
    Privacy laws differ by jurisdiction and how you use data. You should review and adapt this policy with your own
    legal counsel before publishing it.
  </div>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>[Your Company Name]</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
    and shares information when you install or use the
    <strong>AI Channel Copilot</strong> app (“the App”) in connection with your Shopify store (“the Service”).
    It also describes your choices and rights in relation to that information.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Who we are and how to contact us</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided by <strong>[Your Company Name]</strong>, located at
    <strong>[Your Company Address]</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, you can contact us at:<br />
    Email: <a href="mailto:[email protected]">[email protected]</a><br />
    Postal address: <strong>[Your Company Address]</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>2. Relationship to Shopify and merchants</h2>
  <p>
    We build an analytics and reporting app that merchants choose to install in their Shopify stores.
    When a merchant installs the App, Shopify provides us access to certain store data through the Shopify API,
    according to the permissions approved by the merchant.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    For most data about a merchant’s customers, we act as a <em>data processor/service provider</em> on behalf of the
    merchant, who remains the data controller/owner of that data under applicable privacy laws.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Information about merchants and stores</h3>
  <p>When you install and use the App, we may collect and process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Store information: store name, myshopify domain, storefront domain, primary currency and time zone.</li>
    <li>Account information: merchant name, email address, preferred language, and contact details.</li>
    <li>Billing information: subscription plan, billing status, and payment identifiers (handled via Shopify Billing;
        we do not store your full payment card details).</li>
    <li>Configuration data: App settings, rules, preferences, and other data you choose to store in the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Information about orders and customers</h3>
  <p>
    To provide AI-channel analytics and attribution, we access certain data about your orders and customers
    from Shopify, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Order details: order ID, order date, currency, line items, quantities, prices, discounts, taxes, and refunds.</li>
    <li>Basic customer details: customer ID, name, email, phone number (if provided), billing and shipping country/region.</li>
    <li>Traffic attributes: referring site, landing page URL, UTM parameters, tags and note attributes related to the order.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We use this data only to provide and improve the Service (for example, to detect and label orders that likely came
    from AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot).
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Technical and usage data</h3>
  <p>
    When you access the App (for example, from the Shopify admin), our systems may automatically log certain information,
    such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address and approximate location;</li>
    <li>Browser type, operating system, and device information;</li>
    <li>App usage data, such as pages viewed, features used, and time spent;</li>
    <li>Error logs and performance metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.4 Communications</h3>
  <p>
    If you contact us for support or feedback, we may collect the information that you choose to provide,
    such as your name, email address, and the content of your message.
  </p>

  <h2>4. How we use information</h2>
  <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the App and the Service.</li>
    <li>To analyze orders and traffic data and generate AI-channel reports, dashboards, and exports.</li>
    <li>To configure and customize the App for each merchant store.</li>
    <li>To provide merchant support, answer questions, and resolve technical issues.</li>
    <li>To monitor performance, troubleshoot, and improve the App (including usage analytics and A/B testing).</li>
    <li>To detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, abuse, or security incidents.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our agreements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal bases for processing (EEA/UK visitors)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or a similar jurisdiction with data protection
    laws that require a legal basis for processing, we rely on the following legal bases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing is necessary to perform our contract with the merchant (for example, to provide the Service).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> We process data to maintain and improve the App, prevent fraud and abuse,
        and understand how merchants use the Service, where these interests are not overridden by data-subject rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> In some cases, we may rely on your consent (for example, when you sign up for optional marketing emails).
        You can withdraw consent at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. How we share information</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell merchant or customer personal data.</p>
  <p>We may share information in the following situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Service providers:</strong> We use trusted third-party vendors to host our infrastructure, store data,
      send emails, monitor performance, and provide customer support tools. These providers only process data on our
      behalf and under contract.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Business transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of all or a
      portion of our business, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate safeguards.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply
      with law or legal process, to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others, or to enforce our agreements.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Service to the merchant and to satisfy
    the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a merchant uninstalls the App, we generally delete or anonymize store data within
    <strong>[X days/months]</strong>, except where we are legally required to keep it longer (for example, for tax, accounting,
    or audit purposes). Aggregated or de-identified data that no longer identifies an individual may be retained for analytics
    and product improvement.
  </p>

  <h2>8. International data transfers</h2>
  <p>
    We may store and process information in countries other than the country where the merchant or customers are located.
    These countries may have data-protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where required by law, we implement appropriate safeguards for international transfers, such as contractual protections.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Your rights and choices</h2>
  <h3>9.1 Merchant rights</h3>
  <p>
    As a merchant using the App, you may access, correct, update, or delete certain information directly through the App
    or by contacting us. If you wish to uninstall the App, you can do so from your Shopify admin at any time.
  </p>

  <h3>9.2 End-customer rights</h3>
  <p>
    If you are a customer of a merchant using our App and wish to exercise privacy rights (such as access, correction, or deletion),
    please contact the merchant directly. We will support the merchant in responding to such requests as required under
    Shopify’s policies and applicable law.
  </p>

  <h3>9.3 Rights under specific privacy laws</h3>
  <p>
    Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights under local privacy laws (for example, GDPR, UK GDPR,
    and certain U.S. state privacy laws), such as the right to request access to or deletion of your personal data or to
    object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details in Section 1.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful
    destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized access. However, no online service can guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App and Service are intended for use by merchants and business users. They are not directed to children, and we do not
    knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or a higher age where required by local law).
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational,
    legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make material changes, we will notify merchants by email or within the App
    and update the “Effective date” at the top of this page.
  </p>
