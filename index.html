  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>AI Channel Copilot</strong></p>
  <p><small>Effective date: <strong>2025-12-01</strong></small></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>zicai</strong> (“I”, “me”, or “my”)
    collects, uses, and shares information when you install or use the
    <strong>AI Channel Copilot</strong> app (the “App”) on your Shopify store.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Relationship with Shopify and merchants</h2>
  <p>
    The App is a third-party analytics tool for Shopify. When you install the App,
    Shopify provides me access to certain store data via the Shopify API based on the
    permissions you approve. For most data about your customers, I act as a
    service provider / data processor and process that data only on your behalf.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information I collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Store and account information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Store name, myshopify.com domain, storefront domain, primary currency and time zone.</li>
    <li>Merchant contact details such as name and email address.</li>
    <li>App configuration, rules and preferences you set inside the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Orders and customers</h3>
  <p>To provide AI-channel analytics, the App accesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Order data (IDs, dates, line items, prices, discounts, taxes, refunds).</li>
    <li>Basic customer data (Shopify customer ID, name, email, country/region).</li>
    <li>Traffic data such as referring site, landing page URL, UTM parameters,
        tags and note attributes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Technical and usage data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address, browser type, device information.</li>
    <li>Pages and features used, error logs and performance metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How I use this information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, operate and maintain the App.</li>
    <li>To detect and label orders that likely come from AI assistants
        (for example ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot).</li>
    <li>To build reports, dashboards and CSV exports for your store.</li>
    <li>To troubleshoot issues, monitor performance and improve the App.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce my terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How information is shared</h2>
  <p>
    I do <strong>not</strong> sell merchant or customer personal information.
    I may share data only in these cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>With third-party service providers (for example hosting, logging, or email tools)
        that process data on my behalf under contract.</li>
    <li>In connection with a business transfer, if I ever sell or transfer the App.</li>
    <li>When required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect rights and safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    I keep personal information for as long as needed to provide the App and for
    legitimate business or legal purposes. After you uninstall the App, I
    generally delete or anonymize store data within
    <strong>[[X months, for example “6 months”]]</strong>, unless a longer retention
    period is required by law. Aggregated and de-identified data that does not
    identify a person may be kept for analytics and product improvement.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    As a merchant, you can access, update or delete many types of data directly
    from your Shopify admin or by contacting me.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a customer of a merchant using the App and wish to exercise privacy rights
    (for example, access or deletion), please contact the merchant directly. I will
    support the merchant in responding to requests as required by Shopify’s policies
    and applicable law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    I use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, but no
    online service can be completely secure. You are responsible for maintaining
    the security of your own Shopify account and access tokens.
  </p>

  <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Data may be stored and processed in countries other than where you are located.
    Where required, I take steps to ensure appropriate protections are in place for
    such transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If the changes are material,
    I will notify merchants by email or via the App and update the “Effective date”
    at the top of this page.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
